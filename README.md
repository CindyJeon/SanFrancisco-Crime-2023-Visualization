‚ú® The data revealed few points,

1) Most crimes are concentrated in three areas:
   the notorious Tenderloin, Mission, and South of Market(accounting for roughly 40% of total crimes in SF)

2) Crime peaks during two periods: April-June (2nd quarter) and October.
   While the reason isn‚Äôt clear, it may be related to the warmer weather,
   especially since October is known to be one of the best months in SF,
   More people means more chances of crime.
